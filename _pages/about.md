I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Research Center for Frontier Fundamental Studies, Zhejiang Lab, China. I obtained my Bachelor degree from Wuhan Univeristy of Technology (WHUT) in 2017 and Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Manufacturing and Automation from Zhejiang Univerisity (ZJU) in 2023.

My research interests mainly focused on computational imaging and deep learning, including super-resolution microscopy, segmentation, and image fusion, along with exploring their applications in various domains (such as material quality testing and biomedical imaging).
